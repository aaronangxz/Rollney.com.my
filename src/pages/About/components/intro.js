          <p className="details">
            Our founder loves pastries. It was a trip to Hungary that inspired
            him to establish Rollney.
            <br />
            <br />
            While he was walking down a street in Hungary, he passed by a stall
            and was attracted by its distinct aroma of buttery pastries. It was
            as though he was hypnotised by the scent and decided that he had to
            try the pastry for himself. This pastry is none other than the
            Chimney Cake! He took a bite and it was total love at first bite!
            Till this day, the mouthfeel and taste still etched on his memory.
            He pointed at the Chimney cake and said: “I’m definitely bringing
            this back to Malaysia!”
            <br />
            <br /> He then walked back to the stall and shared his mission with
            the stall owner, hoping that he could share his “love at first bite”
            with everyone around the world. It wasn’t an easy feat to convince
            the owner. Although it was a painstaking process to talk the owner
            around, the owner was finally willing to share the recipe and baking
            process with him. <br />
            <br />
            For the next 3 months, he stayed in Hungary to understand the
            culture and to learn the baking process. Once he was back in
            Malaysia, an idea struck him to have the Chimney Cake and Ice Cream
            together, blending the Hungarian culture with Malaysians’ food
            preference.
            <br />
            <br />
            That’s Rollney Malaysia.
